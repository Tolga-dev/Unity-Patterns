The Type Object pattern is a creational design pattern that helps manage objects with similar characteristics but different values for those characteristics. It promotes code flexibility and reduces the need for extensive subclassing. Here's how it works:

### Components:

* Type Object: This object encapsulates the type-specific data and behavior. It defines the properties and methods that are common to a specific type of object. Think of it as a template for objects of that type.
* Typed Object: This object stores a reference to the type object and contains instance-specific data. It represents a concrete instance of a type with its own unique values.

### Benefits:

* Reduced Subclassing: Instead of creating a subclass for every variation, you can define a single typed object class and use different type objects to manage specific behaviors.
* Flexibility: You can easily add new types without modifying existing code. Simply create a new type object and use it with the existing typed object class.
* Decoupling: Type objects and typed objects are loosely coupled. Changes in one don't necessarily affect the other.
